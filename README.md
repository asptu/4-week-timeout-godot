# Discord 4 Week Timeout

![](https://github.com/asptu/4-week-timeout-godot/blob/master/images/1.png)

For some reason discord has the functionality for 4 week timeouts while the client only allows you to time users out for 1 week maximum.

This fixes that.

Insert the user id of the victim, your guild id of choice and your user token at the bottom and you will be granted the ability to time helpless users out for an entire month.

## Notes

- Probably against discord TOS
- Terrible UI
- Won't work if you don't have timeout permissions (It's not magic)
